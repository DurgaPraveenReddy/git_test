        <p>First Paragraph. The spaces are now correctly
            identified. To go to the 2nd line we need to
            use<br>
            "br" element. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This is from 2nd "p" element. The spacing
            between two Paragraphs is due to 
            2nd "p" element.<br>
            <strong>To make this line bold we used</strong>
            the<strong> "strong" </strong>element inside the 2nd <strong>"p"</strong> element.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>This is from the 3rd "p" element.
                The text is italic because 
                we used <strong>"em"</strong> element.
                em stands for <strong>"Emphasize"</strong>.
