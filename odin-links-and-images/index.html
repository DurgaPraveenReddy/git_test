            Links to pages on other websites on the 
            internet are called absolute links. A 
            typical absolute link will be made up of
             the following 
             parts: scheme://domain/path. 
             An absolute link will always contain 
             the scheme and domain of the destination.

        <em>
            The <strong>rel</strong> attribute is 
            used to describe the relation 
            between the current page and 
            the linked document. 
            <strong>noopener:</strong> The noopener 
            value of the rel attribute ensures that 
            a link opened in a new tab or window 
            cannot interact with or access the 
            original page. Without it, the new page 
            can use JavaScript to manipulate the 
            original page, which poses a security 
            risk. <strong>noreferrer:</strong> The 
            noreferrer value of the rel attribute 
            provides both privacy and security. It 
            prevents the new page from knowing where 
            the user came from (hiding the referrer) 
            and also includes the behavior of 
            noopener, preventing the new page from 
            accessing the original page.

        <em>
            Links to other pages within our own 
            website are called relative links. 
            Relative links do not include the domain 
            name, since it is another page on the 
            same site, it assumes the domain name 
            will be the same as the page we created 
            the link on. Relative links only include 
            the file path to the other page, relative
             to the page you are creating the link on.
